Just as one can spend a lot on hobbies like interior  decoration, similarly, one can earn money by selling their hobbies. What brings satisfaction in the world like  earning through one's passion?<br>Hridika Chand, a third-year student in the Department of Mechatronics and Industrial Engineering at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), has independently established an online shop called 'Kaya.' She sells handcrafted wooden jewelry, key rings, hand-painted Punjabis, rickshaw-painted sunglasses, faceless portraits on canvas, hand-painted T-shirts, hand-painted tote bags, and more. Initially, she started selling from CUET, but now her work demands extend beyond the campus and reach across the country.<br>Prittha started her business in February last year. A hand-painted T-shirt was her first product to sell. Initially, most of the buyers were familiar acquaintances and classmates. Although the sales were low at first, they increased significantly after last Durga Puja. Now, she receives so many orders that sometimes she can't even accept more. Prittha's artistic talent blossomed at an early age. Initially, she attended Fulki Easy Learn School in Chittagong. Alongside her studies, she used to practice drawing every day and engage students in various cultural activities. She was inspired by various creative works on Instagram and Pinterest.<br>Since joining CUET, Prittha started tutoring like ten other students. Eventually, regular tutoring became challenging due to the demanding curriculum of the engineering university. Then her elder sister suggested that since earning through hobbies is possible, why not start with that? That's where it all began.<br>The word 'Kaya' means body or physique. Although Prittha's products are made of canvas and are wearable, they focus on the physical body, hence the name 'Kaya.' Prittha is the brains behind all of Kaya's products. While sales within CUET are managed by a friend, products are delivered to customers nationwide through courier services. It has been a long journey to success, with many obstacles. The most challenging part was encouraging people. Many don't appreciate handcrafted items or want to pay less for them. Others believe that tutoring is the best way to stay engaged in student life, so tutoring should be preferred over everything else. Pritha is currently completing her undergraduate degree. At the same time, she's taking Kaya forward. She advises those who aspire to do something like her that if the passion for glasswork lies dormant within them, then without hesitation, they should put their passion to work. Alongside financial gain, they will also find mental peace.
